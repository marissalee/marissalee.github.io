Brief synopsis of projects that I am currently involved in or have completed

Lately, I have been focused on understanding the structure and function of plant-associated microbes. This has been in the context of beneficial symbionts for switchgrass biofuel production and wood decay ecology. I got hooked on this theme because plant-associated microbes were the "elephant in the room" throughout my Ph.D. research, which focused on why some invasive plants can fundamentally alter nitrogen cycling in some habitats but not others.

## Microbial ecology of wood decay
Collaboration with Amy Zanne (George Washington U.), Brad Oberle (), Will Cornwell (), Jeff Powell (), & others

*Background:*
Communities of wood-dwelling fungi mediate tree health and wood decay and in doing so determine a significant portion of terrestrial fixed carbon gains and losses. Consequently, the trajectory of climate change depends in part on how these fungi respond to their environment and each other, so it is necessary to understand which factors mediate the assembly of fungi in wood tissue.

*Approach:*
To address this challenge, we are characterizing wood-dwelling fungal communities a range of wood species from woodlands in NSW, Australia and Missouri, USA.

# Plant invasions & nutrient cycling
Collaboration with Justin Wright (Duke U.), Emily Bernhardt (Duke U.), Rich Phillips (Indiana U.), Luke Flory (U. of Florida) & others

*Background:*
Species can be important actors that mediate ecosystem processes critical to human and ecosystem health, e.g. soil carbon storage, nutrient retention and clean water.  But it is difficult to determine who the important actors are and in which contexts. Motivated by this and the fact that humans have dramatically altered the distribution and abundance of species, the aim of this work has been to better understand linkages and feedbacks between species composition and ecosystem functioning.

*Approach:*
Using model-organism and meta-analytical approaches, I addressed the following questions: (1) Does a plant invader’s nutrient-use strategy predict its impact on nutrient retention and loss? (2) How do the primary forms of nutrients utilized by plants and microbes in an ecosystem mediate a plant invader’s impact? (3) Which is a better predictor of a plant invader’s impact – its abundance or the degree to which it is novel in the invaded system?

Below are a few of the key projects that I have been involved in over the years. Although I have shifted between different systems - plant invasion, wood decay, biofuel production - a consistent theme has been my interest in how organisms and their interactions underpin healthy ecosystems.

________

#### **Structure and function of the switchgrass microbiome**

###### Motivation
<i>Panicum virgatum</i> (switchgrass) is a promising biofuel species that is potentially suitable for cultivation on marginal lands with low inputs. Microbes that live in close association with <i>P. virgatum</i> can have large impacts on its productivity; however, little is known about the diversity and function of these associations. To address this, we have surveyed leaf, root, and soil-associated microbes using molecular and culture-based methods and are currently evaluating plant responses to field-collected isolates.

________

#### **Microbial ecology of wood decay**

###### Motivation
Communities of wood-dwelling fungi mediate tree health and wood decay and in doing so determine a significant portion of terrestrial fixed carbon gains and losses. Consequently, the trajectory of climate change depends in part on how these fungi respond to their environment and each other, so it is necessary to understand which factors mediate the assembly of fungi in wood tissue. To address this challenge, we are characterizing wood-dwelling fungal communities a range of wood species from woodlands in NSW, Australia and Missouri, USA.

________

#### **Plant invasions & nutrient cycling**

###### Motivation
Species can be important actors that mediate ecosystem processes critical to human and ecosystem health, e.g. soil carbon storage, nutrient retention and clean water.  But it is difficult to determine who the important actors are and in which contexts. Using model-organism and meta-analytical approaches, I addressed the following questions: (1) Does a plant invader’s nutrient-use strategy predict its impact on nutrient retention and loss? (2) How do the primary forms of nutrients utilized by plants and microbes in an ecosystem mediate a plant invader’s impact? (3) Which is a better predictor of a plant invader’s impact – its abundance or the degree to which it is novel in the invaded system?<br>

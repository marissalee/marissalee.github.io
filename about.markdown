Hi! My name is Marissa Lee and I am a research scientist located in Raleigh, NC, USA.

This site hosts my electronic resume as well as sporadic updates on what I am working on. Often, this involves content on statistical analysis, microbiome bioinformatics, and data visualization.

When not at my computer, I enjoy spending time with my family, outside in the garden, and helping a big orange cat named Ted live his best life.

Feel free to connect with me on a social media platform ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissa-ruth-lee/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marissaruthlee)) and check out my coding endeavors on [GitHub: @marissalee](https://github.com/marissalee)

Motivated researcher and data scientist, well-versed in problem-solving and project management with domain knowledge in plant-microbe biology and statistical applications. Ready to apply over 10 years of experience in computational, lab, and field research to promote data-driven solutions to global challenges.


Experience

North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC	Sept 2018 to Present
Postdoctoral Researcher, PI: Christine V. Hawkes
•	Led state-wide survey of switchgrass microbiomes to improve biofuel production, generating two peer-reviewed publications and counting
•	Developed and improved computational and lab protocols, e.g., phylogenetic analysis, PCR amplification clamps, seedling assays

The George Washington University, Washington, DC	Sept 2016 to Aug 2018
Postdoctoral Researcher, PI: Amy E. Zanne
•	Designed bioinformatic analyses for complementary microbiome field studies in St. Louis, MO, USA and Hawkesbury, NSW, Australia
•	Applied and adapted bioinformatic and statistical tools for microbiome analysis
•	Translated cutting-edge statistical tools for ecologists interested in microbial interactions

Duke University, Durham, NC	Jun 2010 to May 2016
Environmental Protection Agency-STAR Fellow, Advisor: Justin P. Wright
•	Designed, funded, and ran research on the role of invasive plants in soil fertility
•	Spear-headed a published meta-analysis with researchers at more than 8 universities
Teaching Assistant 	Jan 2011 to May 2014
•	Graded, facilitated in-class activities, and led discussion or lab sections for 5 courses

Indiana University, Bloomington, IN	May 2009 to May 2010
Research Technician, PI: Richard P. Phillips, Keith Clay, S. Luke Flory


Education

PhD	Duke University, University Program in Ecology	 May 2016
Dissertation: “Leaf traits, neighbors, and abiotic factors: Ways that context can mediate the impact of invasive species on nitrogen cycling”

BA	Swarthmore College, Biology	May 2009
	Graduated with High Honors
	Minored in Religion

Skills

- Creative problem-solver: Use and re-purpose computational tools; engineer field and greenhouse supplies for study purposes
- Enthusiastic collaborator: Enjoy working hard with friends to achieve a goal; synthesize views using meta-analysis and cross-disciplinary work
- Data “whisperer": Detect features in big, messy ecological datasets
- Statistical “translator”: Translate statistical result to biological meaning
- Data communicator & science writer	Publish compelling figures and data-driven narratives

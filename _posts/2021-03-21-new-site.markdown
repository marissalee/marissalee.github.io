Hi there! I'm finally leaving the world of Wordpress behind and moving my personal site to GitHub using Jekyll.

After only a bit of tinkering it is up! The [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) have been super easy to use. Plus, I'm pretty happy with the simplicity of the default layout (minima) and the ability to go ad-free.

Perhaps I'll actually add content more frequently??

Here's a throw-back picture of young Ted from about five years ago -- keeping me company while coding. He's a grown-up chonk cat now and we've both learned a lot more about computer work.
